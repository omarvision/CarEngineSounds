# CarEngineSounds
Drive a car around a race track and get good engine/car sounds to go with it.

Without the sounds of a car how can you really make a convincingly fun driving / racing game? But how do you get such dynamic revving sound?? How?! I played around getting my car to drive around a track with engine sounds that I finally felt I liked. See what I did in this tutorial.
